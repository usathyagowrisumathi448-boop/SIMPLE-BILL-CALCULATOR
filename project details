To use arithmetic operators in Python

To calculate the total bill amount

To simulate real-life billing logic

To improve basic Python programming skills

Tools Used

Python 3

VS Code / IDLE

Project Description

This program calculates the subtotal, tax amount, discount amount, and final bill amount based on user inputs such as item price, quantity, tax percentage, and discount percentage. It uses basic arithmetic operators and input/output statements in Python.

Algorithm

Read the item price

Read the quantity

Calculate the subtotal

Read the tax percentage

Calculate the tax amount

Read the discount percentage

Calculate the discount amount

Calculate the final bill amount

Display the bill details

Program Code
# Simple Bill Calculator

price = float(input("Enter price of the item: "))
quantity = int(input("Enter quantity: "))

subtotal = price * quantity

tax_percent = float(input("Enter tax percentage: "))
tax_amount = (subtotal * tax_percent) / 100

discount_percent = float(input("Enter discount percentage: "))
discount_amount = (subtotal * discount_percent) / 100

total_bill = subtotal + tax_amount - discount_amount

print("\n----- BILL DETAILS -----")
print("Subtotal : Rs.", subtotal)
print("Tax Amount : Rs.", tax_amount)
print("Discount Amount : Rs.", discount_amount)
print("Total Bill : Rs.", total_bill)

Sample Output
Enter price of the item: 100
Enter quantity: 2
Enter tax percentage: 10
Enter discount percentage: 5

----- BILL DETAILS -----
Subtotal : Rs. 200.0
Tax Amount : Rs. 20.0
Discount Amount : Rs. 10.0
Total Bill : Rs. 210.0

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of basic arithmetic operators and input/output operations in Python to create a simple and practical billing system. It helps in understanding real-world billing calculations and strengthens fundamental Python programming concepts.
